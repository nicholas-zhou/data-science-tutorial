    "This is a tutorial that walks through the steps of the data lifecycle: data collection, data processing, exploratory analysis & data visualization, hypothesis testing & machine learning, and insight & policy decision. In data science, it is very important to understand data, process it, extract value from it, visualize it, and communicate it. Hopefully by the end of the tutorial, you walk away with a full understanding of the lifecycle and how to apply it!"

We wanted to test whether or not this is true using the different steps of the data lifecycle. Looking at the GDP per capita between 2013 and 2015 for different countries, as well as their immigration rates (to the United States), we can test the validity of this argument.\n",

    "Of course, we want to start by loading in the data. There is a lot of data on the internet available for us to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set for GDP per capita that we used can be found from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/economic-growth). In addition to the data set, this website has a lot of great information on the history of economic growth if you are interested in reading more about it. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also decided on using data from [Data.world](https://data.world/rflprr/us-immigration-statistics-15) for immigration rates. The website requires an account to access the data, but once you create one, you will be able to download the file dhs.xlsx. Notice the file has an Excel sheet extension. To convert that to a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file, open it and go to Table3 at the bottom (it should be the page with Region of birth in cell A1). Then navigate to File -> Export -> Change File Type -> CSV. A popup will tell you that you cannot export multiple sheets. You can click OK and it will only save Table3, which is all we need.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two other sources we considered were [The Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/profiles-lawful-permanent-residents) and [Migration Policy Institute](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/programs/data-hub/us-immigration-trends#source). While the DHS would have been a great source to get immigration numbers, we decided against it because the data for different years were separated into different files. We also could not use the Migration Policy Institute's data because the Excel sheet was formatted, so we could not convert to a CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have the data files, we can bring them into our notebook. Pandas has a function that allows us to read straight from a CSV file and put that data into a DataFrame. DataFrames are two-dimensional data structures similar to SQL tables or spreadsheet data representations. The two CSV files should be in the same folder as the notebook."

There are a couple options: remove the row or encode the missing data. We decided it would be best to encode the data and change it to 0. This is because Comoros has data for 2014 and 2015, so we do not want to remove it entirely. Additionally, its immigration numbers for 2014 and 2015 are pretty low, so it could factor into how few people immigration from this country."

    "Exploratory Data Analysis is the process of finding patterns and the main characteristics of a dataset in order to begin making hypotheses about the data. It is very useful to do this along with Data Visualization because plots and graphs allow you to visualize the patterns. We have a few different options for how we want to visualize the data. The first one to consider is making line graphs for the GDP per capita for each country. However, this would not really show us anything significant, because we cannot see how the GDP per capita affects the immigration rates."
